<h2>Cop Quest</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Broken
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I was hoping to make this into an adventure game.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Adventure game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You can aimlessly walk around and you can crash the game if you walk into the door that has incomplete functionality.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I wanted to build upon my knowledge base to give me more powerful tools to make games down the line.  I learned how to make and use terrains in tiled, as well as how to create rules for automapping, and creating objects in Tiled and manipulating them in Phaser.  My collision layer is almost entirely automapped, and the player's starting point is a part of the Object layer in Tiled.  The project stalled at the door object, however, as the action I was attempting to ascribe to the door was to change tilemaps to move from the overworld to the interior of a building, but trying to set the layers for the tilemap the second time around just results in undefined layers and crashing.  I have not been able to find any examples of multiple tilemaps being used in a traditional manner, but I had read that it's something that may need to be done using game states, which I will have to look into for next time.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Now with 25% more Electrolytes.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It appears to be a grassy world with some water and dirt, and a singular character who walks around.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I'd be disappointed if this did have an audience as is.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Minimal.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Nothing can help you in this desolate world of nothing to do.
